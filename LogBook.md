Spot on CSV parsing because OV-Chipkaart also provides CSV files that can also be read an they can also be easily read to be kept anonymous.

While on Xmas holiday ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„, with family and friends, and having to fill-out the public transportation declaration, I've
decided to terminate project `BiscaJE` and in its place create a public transport declarer.

## Goals

The project is supposed to provide an easy way to generate documentation required to make public transportation usage
declarations.
